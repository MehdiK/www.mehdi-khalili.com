I am proud to pronounce that a couple of weeks ago I received my first Microsoft MVP Award! This award is based on my open source contribution. So I would like to thank those who nominated me and my open source work, folks at Microsoft who pushed for OSS nomination, and last but not least the great community behind my open source projects.

[Open source is a rather thankless job](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OpenSourceIsAThanklessJobWeDoItAnyway.aspx). A lot of effort is put into creating, maintaining and promoting an open source project. If you use an OSS project, consider contributing something back. It could be documentation, logo, automation scripts, bug fixes or new features. While you're at it, you could also [nominate the authors](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/nominate-an-mvp.aspx) for MVP Award. It is a nice way to thank them for their efforts. 

Once again, thanks all! This is quite exciting for me :)
