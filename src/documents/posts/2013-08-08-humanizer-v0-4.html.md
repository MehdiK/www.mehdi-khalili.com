Over a year ago [I blogged](/introducing-humanizer) about Humanizer: a micro-framework that helps .Net developers turn strings, type names, enum fields, date fields and numbers into a human friendly format. It has since become a rather popular framework. I am happy to announce the release of Humanizer V0.4 with a fair few useful additions. 

The current feature set in a nutshell is:

 * Humanize strings; e.g. `"WhenSomethingIsSet".Humanize()` -> `"When something is set"`
 * Humanize enums; e.g. `AuthType.AnonymousUser.Humanize()` -> `"Anonymous user"` 
 * Humanize dates; e.g. `DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1).Humanize()` -> `"Yesterday"`
 * Humanize method accepts an optional casing parameter with support for different casings: Title, Sentence, Lower Case, Upper Case; e.g. `"WhenSomethingIsSet".Humanize(LetterCasing.Title)` -> `"When Something Is Set"`
 * Can Inject the date you want to use as basis for date comparison (added in V0.3)
 * Date humanization can be localized (added in V0.3)
 * Dehumanize strings (added in V0.3.1); e.g. `"When something is set"` -> `"WhenSomethingIsSet".Dehumanize()`
 * Dehumanize string into enum (added in V0.3.2); e.g. `"Anonymous user".Dehumanize<AuthType>()` ->  `AuthType.AnonymousUser`
 * Inflector methods courtesy of Inflector.Net (added in V0.4):
	 * Pluralize; e.g. `"Man".Pluralize()` -> `"Men"` & `"string".Pluralize()` -> `strings`
	 * Singularize; e.g. `"Men".Singularize()` -> `"Man"` & `"strings".Singularize()` -> `string`
	 * Ordinalize numbers; e.g. `1.Ordinalize()` -> `"1st"`, `5.Ordinalize()` -> `"5th"`
	 * Ordinalize strings; e.g. `"21".Ordinalize()` -> `"21st"`
	 * Underscore; e.g. `"SomeTitle".Underscore()` -> `"some_title"` 
	 * Dasherize; e.g. `"some_title".Dasherize()` ->  `"some-title"`
 
To learn more about the framework and it's API please refer to [readme.md](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer) on github.

Humanizer has a good test coverage and even though it's a pre-release framework it is quite solid and a lot of teams have been using it in production since V0.2.

Happy Humanizing :)
