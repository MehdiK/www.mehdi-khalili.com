I carried around a text file for quite a few years and every time I heard a great software related quote I'd add it to the file. The file got relatively big so I thought I could turn it into a website to make it easy to discover and share these quotes for myself and others. So [Software Quotes](http://www.software-quot.es) was born. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all quotes about software development but rather those I find interesting and influential or funny. Here is a few examples:

 - *"[Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.](http://www.software-quot.es/programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-incidentally-for-machines-to-execute/)"* - Abelson and Sussman
 - *"[Crash programs fail because they are based on the theory that, with nine women pregnant, you can get a baby a month.](http://www.software-quot.es/with-nine-women-pregnant-can-you-get-a-baby-a-month/)"* - Wernher von Braun
 - *"[Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.](http://www.software-quot.es/work-expands-so-as-to-fill-the-time-available-for-its-completion/)"* - Parkinson’s Law
 - *"[Perfection is reached, not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.](http://www.software-quot.es/perfection-is-reached-not-when-there-is-no-longer-anything-to-add/)"* - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
 - *"[It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.](http://www.software-quot.es/it-is-better-to-be-roughly-right-than-precisely-wrong/)"* - John Maynard
 - *"[One Man's Crappy Software Is Another Man's Full Time Job.](http://www.software-quot.es/one-mans-crappy-software-is-another-mans-full-time-job/)"* - Jessica Gaston

The website still has quite a few rough edges and issues. Well, I thought [if I am not embarrassed by my first product release, I've released too late](http://www.software-quot.es/if-youre-not-embarrassed-by-your-first-product-release-youve-released-too-late/)! 

The source code of the blog, which is based on Octopress, is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/MehdiK/software-quotes). So if you find any issues or mistakes or if you would like to contribute an awesome quote either raise an issue on GitHub or even better send me a pull request.

I hope you find this useful.
