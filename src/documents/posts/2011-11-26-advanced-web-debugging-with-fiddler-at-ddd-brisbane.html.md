I just finished up my talk, [Advanced Web Debugging With Fiddler][2], at [DDD Brisbane][3]. The turn up was good and the audience walked out happy :) 

You can download the slides from [here][4]. And here are some photos:

I think I was explaining the Man In The Middle attack here:

You may see more photos from the conference and other sessions [here][7]. Thanks a lot Bronwen for the photos. 

Happy fiddling.
