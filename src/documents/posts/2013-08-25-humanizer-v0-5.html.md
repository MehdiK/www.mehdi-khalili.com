This post is about the features added in V0.5 and some of the other changes. If you don't know Humanizer you might want to read this [intro](http://www.mehdi-khalili.com/introducing-humanizer) and [Humanizer V0.4](http://www.mehdi-khalili.com/humanizer-v0-4)'s release notes. 

Humanizer V0.5 provides a fluent API to deal with `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` as follows:

`TimeSpan` methods:

	2.Milliseconds() // Returns new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 0, 2)
	2.Seconds() // Returns new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 2)
	2.Minutes() // Returns new TimeSpan(0, 0, 2, 0)
	2.Hours() // Returns new TimeSpan(0, 2, 0, 0)
	2.Days() // Returns new TimeSpan(2, 0, 0, 0)
	2.Weeks() // Returns new TimeSpan(14, 0, 0, 0)

<small>There are no fluent APIs for month or year as a month could have between 28 to 31 days and a year could be 365 or 366 days.</small>

You could use these methods to, for example, replace
 
    DateTime.Now.AddDays(2).AddHours(3).AddMinutes(-5)

with 

    DateTime.Now + 2.Days() + 3.Hours() - 5.Minutes()

There are also fluent methods to deal with `DateTime`:

	In.TheYear(2010) // Returns the first of January of 2010
	In.January // Returns 1st of January of the current year
	In.FebruaryOf(2009) // Returns 1st of February of 2009
	In.One.Second //  DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(1);
	In.Two.SecondsFrom(DateTime dateTime)
	In.Three.Minutes // With corresponding From method
	In.Three.Hours // With corresponding From method
	In.Three.Days // With corresponding From method
	In.Three.Weeks // With corresponding From method
	In.Three.Months // With corresponding From method
	In.Three.Years // With corresponding From method
	On.January.The4th // Returns 4th of January of the current year
	On.February.The(12) // Returns 12th of Feb of the current year

and some extension methods:

	var someDateTime = new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 5, 25, 45, 125);
	someDateTime.In(2008) // Returns new DateTime(2008, 2, 10, 5, 25, 45, 125) changing the year to 2008
	someDateTime.At(2) // Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 2, 25, 45, 125) changing the hour to 2:25:45.125
	someDateTime.At(2, 20, 15) // Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 2, 20, 15, 125) changing the time to 2:20:15.125
	someDateTime.AtNoon() // Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 12, 0, 0) changing the time to 12:00:00.000
	someDateTime.AtMidnight() // Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 0, 0, 0) changing the time to 00:00:00.000

Obviously you could chain the methods too; e.g. `On.November.The13th.In(2010).AtNoon + 5.Minutes()`

In this release there is also a cool new `ToWords` extension method which changes numbers to words. Here is a few examples from the unit tests: 

    Assert.Equal("one", 1.ToWords());
    Assert.Equal("ten", 10.ToWords());
    Assert.Equal("eleven", 11.ToWords());
    Assert.Equal("one hundred and twenty-two", 122.ToWords());
    Assert.Equal("three thousand five hundred and one", 3501.ToWords());

In this release we also get Romanian localization for `DateTime` `Humanize`. As a side note, as the number of supported locales increased I also changed the nuget package to instead of embedding the localization resources to include them in the nuget package properly; so now the package looks like:

![Localized Humanizer nuget](/get/blogpictures/humanizer.png)

If this is the first time you see Humanizer you should check out the [readme on github](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer) to see the full API.
