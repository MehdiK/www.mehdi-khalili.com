I had been carrying around a text file for some 10 years now and every time I heard a great software related quote I'd add it to the end of the file. The file got relatively big and had quite a lot of quotes in it and I thought I could turn it into a website to make it easy to discover and share these quotes for myself and others. So [software-quot.es](http://software-quot.es>software-quot.es) was born. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all great quotes about software development but rather those I find interesting and influential or funny. Here is a few examples:

*"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."* - [Abelson and Sussman](http://www.software-quot.es/programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-incidentally-for-machines-to-execute/)

*"Crash programs fail because they are based on the theory that, with nine women pregnant, you can get a baby a month.* - [Wernher von Braun](http://www.software-quot.es/with-nine-women-pregnant-can-you-get-a-baby-a-month/)

*"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."* - [Parkinson’s Law](http://www.software-quot.es/work-expands-so-as-to-fill-the-time-available-for-its-completion/)

*"Perfection is reached, not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away."* - [Antoine de Saint-Exupéry](http://www.software-quot.es/perfection-is-reached-not-when-there-is-no-longer-anything-to-add/)

*"It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong"* - [John Maynard](http://www.software-quot.es/it-is-better-to-be-roughly-right-than-precisely-wrong/)

*"One Man's Crappy Software Is Another Man's Full Time Job."* - [Jessica Gaston](http://www.software-quot.es/one-mans-crappy-software-is-another-mans-full-time-job/)

The website still has quite a few rough edges and issues. [If you’re not embarrassed by your first product release, you’ve released too late](http://www.software-quot.es/if-youre-not-embarrassed-by-your-first-product-release-youve-released-too-late/)! The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/MehdiK/software-quotes). So if you find any issues or mistakes or if you would like to contribute an awesome quote either raise an issue on GitHub or even better send me a pull request.

I hope you find this useful.
