This is my first article in the Tips'n'Tricks series. These articles are going to be very short. I will spend no more than 30 minutes on each one and it should not take you more than a few minutes to read.

In this series I will post things that I would otherwise tweet about if I liked tweeter ;-) You never know. I may one day find tweeter useful and start tweeting - till then I am going to do it old-fashioned.

##Code Definition Window
The Code Definition Window in Visual Studio 2010 is very handy (if you have dual or big monitor).
