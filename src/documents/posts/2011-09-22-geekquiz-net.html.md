Geeky quizzes for geeks and coding enthusiasts
"""
---
[GeekQuiz.Net][1] is a website in which I post geeky quizzes for geeks and coding enthusiasts! The contents are not going to be technology specific and I post about anything I find interesting which fits into the quiz category and is easy to setup and explain. That said it is most likely going to be from Microsoft technology stack which is where I spend most of my time.

I publish the answer in less than a week from the time the quiz is published and until then all the responses will be kept private.
