My name is Mehdi Khalili. I am a senior consultant at the most awesome software consultation company [ThoughtWorks](/joining-thoughtworks) working out of the New York office. Before ThoughtWorks I worked as a senior developer for another really awesome software consultation company called [Readify](http://www.readify.net/) and lived in Gold Coast in South East Queensland in Australia.

I live with my beautiful wife, Shadi, and my funny little boy, Benjamin, in Long Island New York (that is until we decide to migrate to another continent again which has become a pattern in my life)!

In this blog, I will try to write about things that interest me as well as those that annoy me :p My main interests are programming (C#, Javascript, Ruby and Rails), Agile and Lean.

Over the years I have created and contributed to a few open source projects:

 - Created [BDDfy](https://github.com/TestStack/TestStack.BDDfy): The simplest to use and extend BDD framework for .Net.
 - Created [Humanizer](http://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer): A micro framework that helps .Net developers turn their otherwise geeky strings, type names, enum fields, date fields into a human friendly format
 - Co-founded [TestStack](http://teststack.net/): a collection of awesome and unique testing tools and frameworks (so far only for .Net).
 - Contributing on [Seleno](https://github.com/TestStack/TestStack.Seleno): Seleno helps you write automated UI tests the RIGHT way!

Although not actively maintained, I have a working prototype of FunnelWeb blog engine running on RavenDB database that you can access [here](http://code.google.com/r/armkhalili-funnelweb-on-ravendb/). To find out more about the codebase and its pros and cons you may read my post about it [here](/funnelweb-on-ravendb).
