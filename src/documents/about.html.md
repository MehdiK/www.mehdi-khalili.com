##About Me

<img align="right" src="/get/me-small.png" alt="my photo" />

My name is Mehdi Khalili. I am a senior consultant at the most awesome software consultation company [ThoughtWorks](/joining-thoughtworks) working out of the New York office. Before ThoughtWorks I worked as a senior developer for another really awesome software consultation company called [Readify](http://www.readify.net/) and lived in Gold Coast in South East Queensland in Australia.

I live with my beautiful wife, Shadi, and my funny little boy, Benjamin, in Long Island New York (that is until we decide to migrate to another continent again which has become a pattern in my life)!

In this blog, I will try to write about things that interest me as well as those that annoy me :p My main interests are programming (C#, Javascript, Ruby and Rails), Agile and Lean. **If this is your first time here, you should checkout my [greatest hits](/greatest-hits).**
